There we are. There's not much to say about this. I am not sure what the plan is but I work on this as I think of cool stuff that relate to some form of minimalism in a Terminal.

I like to use this in Cool-Retro-Term on a vertical screen for maximum old school feelings. I hope you enjoy it.

If you like this you can donate to whoever needs it, hopefully it won't be me anytime soon.
